have been meaning to check this place out since it opened, been hearing good things from friends 'bout it
i went for late lunch the place was empty but boy howdy i was very happy i finally went
kinda little bargrill like on OB in san diego
who knew in the hidden strip mall next to the check cashing storethe beer was icy goodness
the wings crispy, tasty
we got lunch menu fish and chips and fish and shrimp taco plates
**fish and chip###4.0### 5.0
**taco###4.0### 5.0
both came with the yummy fries that make life a good thing
everything was fresh and good to the last morsel
the waiter said they have different specials thru the week, one is kids eat free and one buy one get one half off
there were posters up for the fight this weekend and they had the projector tv so sports bars vibe also
they have beeroyster shooter specials in the mornings so early games during football season might be a staple in the fall
i sure hope this place makes a go of it cuz it makes me happy to leave the house
Went today for lunch and had some wings and oysters
**oyster###4.0### 4.0
Everything I saw the chef make was fresh no hidden kitchen in the back full of microwaves
It was very good
cool atmosphere too
I look forward to going back to try dinner sometime
My husband and I have been wanting to come to this place for some time since we moved right down the street from here
We were a little put off by the no firearms sign on the door, but after a long Monday we just wanted to watch some football, eat some seafood and grab a few cold ones
**seafood###2.0###3.0
We came into this place and sat at the bar so we could watch some Monday Night Football on their flatscreens
We both ordered some fish tacos since it was their Monday special and split an order of buffalo shrimp
**buffalo###3.0### 2.0
**fish taco###3.0### 4.0
Shrimp was not the typical Red Hot buffalo style you'd expect
**buffalo###3.0### 3.0
Instead they were loaded with other seasonings, but fairly decent
The fish tacos were delicious though
**fish taco###3.0### 4.0
My husband claimed they were the best fish tacos he's ever had
We also ordered a barbacoa tacoand then another after having a tasteWOW
I didn't think I would ever say this in my life, but these tacos blew my mom's homemade ones out of the park
**taco###3.0### 5.0
They were absolutely delicious
Drinks were cheap on happy hour
Bartender even offered me 2 drinks to make sure I could get them at happy hour price before it ended in the next 2 minutes
We came back for their brunch buffet on Sunday
**buffet###4.0### 3.0
It was just okay
Not a whole lot of selection
I'd much rather stick to their menu
Overall   Good, friendly service, great food 
Kick back, no trouble kind of ambience, although the sign outside makes u think otherwise
So, it was our first visit to Pelican Bay, and we'll certainly be returning
Now, their prices are a bitsteep
However, it's just around the corner from us, and such a lovely, cozy little hole in the wall that I can't resist loving it
I had the peel and eat shrimp
**shrimp###4.0###3.0

a little crazy, to be honestbut, the bartender was attentive, and they have a fabulous selection of seafood and Mexican food
**seafood###3.0### 4.0
unfortunately, the beer selections were lacking
stick with Negra, and you're golden

Went here because we bought the Groupon
Given their prices we were expecting the place to be more upscale, instead of sports bar ish and were a little taken aback at first
The waiter was great, very nice and kept our drinks refilled
We ordered the Clam Chowder which you can only get in a bread bowl, or with the bread bowl made into garlic bread
**bread bowl###3.0###3.0

**garlic bread###3.0###5.0
I was kind of put off by this but the garlic bread was literally the best I've ever tasted in my life
**garlic bread###5.0### 5.0
I have no clue what kind of magic spices they added to it, but it was delicious
The Clam Chowder was also good, though a little on a overly clammy side 
**clam chowder###5.0### 4.0
I ordered the Fish and chips and my husband got the Fried Shrimp and Chips, both were good, but we ended up switching lol
**chip###3.0###3.0
The portions were huge, we ended up eating the rest for lunch the next day
We will definitely be going back
We went to Pelican Bay the other night because we had a Groupon coupon to there and we wanted to try it out
 I recently moved from the west valley to the southwest valley
Huge difference in everything
The SW side SUCKS but at least this is a temporary move
Finding good food out here is like trying to find a needle in a haystackthey are out there just not common
Lets put it this way Surprise Arizona is a food mecca compared to Tolleson
Its all chains out here and a few independent gems that I have really search out and love
All in all a very good meal
I got the seafood special pasta and it was very good, pricey but very good
**seafood###5.0###5.0

My only complaints about this dish 1 it was all gone 2 odd of shrimp, cant evenly split it
**shrimp###1.0###1.0
The bar was hopping too
I'd go back for a beer any time
The waitress was a little strange, attentive but there were a lot of awkward silences between us and her
It was just odd
It's more than a 3 star but less than a 4 I went 4 Its not a chain, they try hard, food is good, good bar, and its in Tolleson
If you live out this way please stop in and have some food and drink
If I lived in Mesa I wouldn't drive out here
So summaryPro'sdecent food in the Tolleson areaA decent bar in the Tolleson areaA non chain restaurant in this godforsaken areaCoconut shrimpVictoria beerCon'sPricelots of UofA fans

This is small sports barrestaurant hole in the wall place and it's very relaxed
The seafood is very good
**seafood###5.0### 5.0
The only really bad thing about this place is the prices
That's the only reason I don't come here more often
Cold beers n great ambiance
The fish tacos ARE THE BEST IN AZ 
**fish taco###3.0###5.0
Great little neigborhood pub where there are no pubs
It is the only bar in the area and has some great little specials daily along with some pretty decent food selections
Some prices are great and others seem pricey for the type of place it is
All you can eat fish and chips on Friday is a good deal, wings are great here
**fish and chip###5.0###4.0
They have a half pound cheeseburger that is awesome and very reasonably priced, but fries are extraI think the place could use some management advice for a few little turn offs that may cost them business
Drink specials are decent though they need help with some of their drink recipes as the margarita I had tasted really odd
Great for beers and food specials though and not a bad place to kick back and relax
