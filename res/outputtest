###U.S Egg recently opened in the space where "Blue Plate Brunchery" had been....  Same menu as their other locations.
Veggie Benedict,Breakfast Burrito,fruit###We had the Veggie Benedict, Breakfast Burrito, Biscuits and gravy, and the fruit platter...
###
###they have just opened but everythign was good and the service was attentive.
###Only complaint was that teh potatoes were undercooked, but I am not a big fan so it was no biggie...
###Went there this last Friday, as that's my "breakfast out" morning.
###Thought I'd give it a try.
###The former restaurant (Blue Plate Brunchery) in this location was just "ok."
###This isn't much better.
toast,bacon###Eggs were ok, and it's hard to blow it on toast, but the bacon was so overdone that I thought it had to have been sitting under a warmer for quite awhile, and the potatoes were dry and I think "out of a bag" from some frozen pre-cut brand.
fork###The plates are WAY too small, and everytime you tried to get a fork-full of potatoes they slid off the plate.
###Coffee was burnt - tasted worse then the overcooked Starbucks brand.
###Back to Village Inn for me.
###This place is alright.
###There's really nothing remarkable to say about it other than when I asked for a Diet Coke to drink, the girl gave me two glasses and kept them constantly full.
###When we came in, it was pretty busy and we were quoted a short 10-15 minutes.
###We waited for a bit until we heard that the "bar" was open so we made ourselves comfortable there.
###The menu is really big and honestly, too hard for me to look at.
###The print is pretty small.
###I decided to keep it simple since pretty much everything on the menu seemed to have stuff I don't like in it.
waffle,bacon###I chose the Belgian (not Belgium people!) waffle with a side of bacon.
waffle###The waffle was okay.
waffles###It was filling and tasty, but it was lacking that crisp exterior that makes these big waffles so good.
bacon###The bacon was a little overcooked for my taste, but not bad.
###I probably wouldn't come back unless we were absolutely starving and happened to be in this area because places like this are pretty much a dime a dozen.
###So I've been wanting to go to US Egg for a while but with it being so far out of the way, I just never made it.
###We happened upon this one last week so when the weekend rolled around, I knew we'd be visiting.
###Now I have seen this shopping center change so many times over the years.
###The old movie theater, the indoor mini golf, and now a giant Super Target and a bunch of other weird stuff.
###It's a pretty awesome location though, all things considered.
###The quoted 15min wait turned into a 5 minute wait since the bar opened up.
sodas###Our waitress was awesome and brought my wife two sodas so that she never went empty.
###My OJ wasn't bad either so we were off to a good start.
pancakes,skillet###I ordered the Half-&-Half which is supposed to be two small protein pancakes and a skillet meal.
Cajun skillet,pancakes###I ordered the Cajun skillet to go with my pancakes and, I gotta say, I was not impressed.
pancakes###The pancakes were pretty good.
###I really liked them but there was no way I could eat a whole order of them.
skillet###The skillet, however, was just terrible.
###There was no spice, no real flavor other than wet veggies.
runny tomato juice flavor ruins everything###I hate when that runny tomato juice flavor ruins everything and that's exactly what happened here.
###It was just not good.
pancakes,skillet###Had I stopped with the pancakes, this would have been a 4 star review but that skillet was just bad.
skillet###I'd probably go back and order something more simple (like French toast) next time, but that skillet was just bad bad bad.
###Starting a day of errands and shopping.. started remembering I had not eaten and needing some caffeine..
###I see US Egg in my peripherial.. next stop.. a booth with a awesome waitress remineniscent of my grandmother named Sue.. Seriously if the food had truly sucked.. which it didnt , she rated a 5.. and thats just hard to achieve today in our country..
protein pancakes Sue###I got the protein pancakes.. Sue told me she felt thatd be too much for me.. so she split the order.. good call..
###I ate only half the half order..
###I loved them!
coffee,fruit,coffee###Awesome coffee.. and a side of fruit.. she took my pot of coffee.. poured it into the to go cup.. fresh cream and thats it.. Im ready for errand running and jean shopping..Way to go:=)
###Fantastic!
###Same great food service as Tempe.
###This location is only a few miles from my house.
###Need someplace to get a bite to eat  and  like a plain breakfast?
###Well US Egg is probably your spot.
###This place has the makings of  a good little restaurant but it falls short of making any outstanding items not to mention the decor falls flat as well.
###Let me take you back many moons to a era when ASU kids would go to US Egg on Mill  after a night of fun .
###I was one of those kids  and I loved their omelet and biscuits at that time.
###They had a cutesy americana vibe and I thought I was pretty cool hanging there.
###So when I saw a US Egg near my  hood I thought it would be great to take Mom and give it a try.
###I immediately was bugged by the decor , it is americana gone wrong and cheap ..I have so many ideas to fix up the place Mom and I brain stormed all the possibilities , first we would throw out the plastic tropical plants throughout the joint, this is about kitschy not  an aquarium .
red###We would take out the cheap blue cloth booth seats and hard wooden uninspired chairs for red Naugahyde and  chrome stools .Give it a bunch of fun metal signs and some whimsical tablecloths and we might love it!
###We will let you keep the yellow walls  and big black and white pics.
###Now for the food  my low carb omelet  was so bored I heard it  whining about nothing to do..
###It was called the Dan Marjerle ,who I thought was exciting back in the day , but his poor omelet seemed to lack seasoning or creativity .
avocado###Slices of avocado don't make you unique.
pancakes###Daughter liked her humongous hang off the plate whole wheat pancakes , so that was nice.
bread###Of course she loves whole loaves of plain bread so consider that.
rye bread###Grandma though her Patty Melt was quite tasty and it did look good, served on a dark rye bread it looked not so bad.
###But I didn't see or smell anything earthshaking.
patty###Can you go wrong with cheese , a patty and onions ?
###Service was  pretty good considering it was lunch time.
beverages###I liked that they brought pitchers of beverages not just a cup.
###Waitress was nice and easily and quickly  met our requests.
###The host remembered my name and went out of his was to say goodbye ,also a nice touch.
###i want to say I found a great little place with unique breakfasts  but as you know I never lie...
pancakes###There is nothing like the power pancakes!!
###Service: Very good.
###Both times I've been here we were promptly seated and constantly checked on.
iced tea###If you order a water or iced tea they bring you a glass and leave the pitcher!
sodas###For sodas they bring two!
###The food also came out very quickly.
###Food: Very good.
pancakes,pancakes###I've had the signature protein pancakes and the choco-nana (I think) pancakes.
granola###The former are good; The flavor reminds me of granola.
###The later was fantastic and will probably lead to an early death.
chocolate chip,banana pancakes,ball,vanilla ice cream###It is chocolate chip and banana pancakes with a big ball of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup on top.
###Fantastic.
###All the portions are HUGE so come hungry.
###Price: Reasonable.
###You definitely get what you pay for, and some.
###Appearance/Location: Let's be honest, the place isn't going to win any style awards, but it is open, bright, and clean.
###I don't go to restaurants to look at wall art anyway.
###It is in a great location with a lot of other food and shopping.
###Bottom Line: A great joint for breakfast with tons of great food.
###I'll be back.
###I still say nothing beats Matt's Big Breakfast downtown, but when one doesn't want to wait an hour plus to get seated, there has to be a contingency plan.
###U.S. Egg is a great option!
###I don't know what's better at this place: the food or the service.
###We've always been seated within seconds of walking in, and our servers have been prompt to take our drink and food orders without making us feel rushed.
iced tea,tea###Another bonus: order iced tea and they bring a whole pitcher of tea out with your first glass!
Order soda###Order soda and they'll bring two glasses to start, always replacing one when it runs dry.
###Water glasses and a water pitcher are brought without being asked, which is nice.
###Servers seem well-versed in the menu, and are always happy to make a recommendation or chat about the food if asked.
skillet###The first time I came here, I got a skillet, and our server rightfully warned me that it was a LOT of food.
###I could barely finish half.
###It would be a great dish to share if two people were in the mood to eat the same thing.
pancake###On the second visit I decided to mix it up a bit, and I got a pancake plate with eggs and potatoes.
###Eggs and potatoes were pretty basic.
###They were seasoned well, but certainly not the best I've ever had.
pancakes###The pancakes, however...
###
protein pancakes###Get the protein pancakes.
###I can't emphasize that enough.
wheat pancake batter,granola,blueberries###Whole wheat pancake batter, granola, almonds, blueberries, cinnamon...these are absolutely divine.
protein waffle###Apparently they now make a protein waffle (that will be my next culinary adventure here), which sounds equally as amazing.
###Decor is kitschy, but in a good way.
###It feels like you stepped back in time to the 70s.
###Honestly, I'm not one to shave points off a rating just because the restaurant is less than aesthetically pleasing, but I don't have the problem with the decor that other reviewers seem to have.
###Maybe my kitsch tolerance is much higher than theirs.
###U.S. Egg also has a lunch menu as they're open until the early afternoon, but it's not as tempting as the breakfast menu.
###Service staff seems happy to let you sit and chat for a while after you're done with your food, which I've found to be most gratifying.
###Prices are great, especially for the amount of food that you get.
###I'm happy to go here again and again.
###I am so in love with this restaurant!
###I have yet to order anything, or see anyone order anything, that looks disappointing.
protein pancakes###Above all, please make sure you try the protein pancakes!
wheat pancakes,granola,blueberries###They are whole wheat pancakes with granola, brown sugar, blueberries, and almonds inside.
###It is an amazing burst of flavor over and over again.
pancakes,skillet###My advice: get the full order to share... or order the "half and half" which is a smaller portion of the pancakes with an sort of small skillet bake.
###This place is chill, welcoming, friendly, and absolutely delicious.
###I take all of my guests here to show off the great breakfast food in the valley.
toast,sausage###Here's how our first time at US Egg went: Greeted with an attitude, Burnt toast, microwaved sausage, greasy potatoes, slow service....We won't be back
###We have been hitting this place up quite a bit after our Sunday Church sessions.
###Honestly, if there was a cheaper alternative closer, we would probably go there, I don't have any complaints about the service or the food, but the pricing for what you get does not stack up.
coffees###It's about $9 average per place, I am always really full and hardly ever finish my plate but it really hits the pocket after two plates, and two coffees.
###So I'd say until the prices drop a little, this place is just average.
###US Egg located on Greenway.
###The service was good, no complaints there.
Durango breakfast burrito###I ordered the Durango breakfast burrito.
###It was delivered in a 'gravy boat.'
###I soon realized why, it was soupy.
###The wrap was wet and laying in water.
###The taste was okay but, nothing over the top.
###When you walk into a breakfast place at 7AM on a Saturday morning and you're one of the few people there, it's a sign...
###In an attempt to branch out on our Sunday afternoon breakfasts my peeps and I decided to eat here.
###I was the only first timer.
###It was ok, but pretty expensive, $15, for what it was.
###I ordered the Arizona Fritatta.
sour cream,english muffin###Lots of veggies in an omelet with cheese, sour cream, and salsa served with potatoes and an english muffin.
###The fritatta was nice, the potatoes were horrible, no flavor and cold.
###The service left a bit to be desired.
###We had to ask a random busser to bring us ketchup, jam, and syrup.
###I'd give them another shot, but it was just ok.
###I eat at this place at least once a week!
protein pancakes###Love the protein pancakes.
###They give you a ton of food as well.
###Onwers always there and never to busy to come say hello.
burritos###There is really no great places to eat breakfast in Phoenix for what I like - which are breakfast burritos.
breakfast burrito,chili###I had the breakfast burrito at U.S. Egg - and it was good, but I would have to advise them to make it a tad different, maybe with more green chili.
###However, I really do like this place.
###It's next door to me.
###When I walk in - I am greeted by this lovely hostess (who was wearing a birthday hat) and another nice guy who must be the owner/manager.
###They typically hand me a menu and I venture over to the counter.
###I always eat there alone.
###The wait staff there are all women and all incredibly nice.
###I like how they bring you an entire PITCHER of water and COFFEE.
pancakes,benedict###The pancakes are the best in town and the eggs benedict are nothing to snicker at either!!
###Not a bad place I think they have a pretty extensive menu and are pretty consistent in delivering great flavors.
###A more than decent breakfast spot that'll do in a pinch when we need something close by with a reliable menu and comfortable breakfast food.
###We went here a couple weeks ago on our Sunday Brunch Day.
###The wait is as to be expected for any breakfast joint on a weekend but not ridiculously long.
###Our server was pleasant and as attentive as she could be with the crowded restaurant and her numerous tables.
###My dish was typical (so typical that I honestly can't remember what it was)breakfast fare and it tasted like food I could have made at home.
bang###Not a bad thing at all but sometimes when I go out for food I'm looking for some extra bang or a nice treat.
pancakes###The winner here is actually their protein pancakes which my fiance ordered and I ended up stealing more than a couple bites from his plate.
###If we decide to go back here, that is definitely what I'll be ordering for myself.
###Good food but TERRIBLE service
###We just left US Egg first lost our ticket, then served cold food Management never apologized and refused to comp a meal.
coffee,coffee###Management comped our coffee which was funny as we had the cup of free coffee from outside!
###I just tried U.S. Egg for the first time.
french toast,bacon###I have the french toast with egg and bacon.
###It was fine.
###I might go back and try something more imaginative next time.
###Not much you can say about what I ordered other than it was fine, typical breakfast fare.
###The service was quick and the staff friendly.
###Took the advice on Yelp and tried this place and their Protein Pancakes...really good!
granola,blueberries,pancake###A great combination of granola, blueberries and cinammon in a big pancake that completely covered the plate.
###They also set down a full pitcher of water and carafe of coffee...thank you very much!
###This place should be a lot busier.
###We left for IHOP and ended up at US Egg.
###I made the suggestion because, in all honestly, I don't care much for IHOP and I'm always looking to try something new.
###US Egg was neat and tidy and offered a decent menu selection.
###They offer traditional diner fare with more healthy eating selections.
###I don't eat healthy so that means nothing to me.
###If your a person that counts calories, you just may find something on the US Egg menu to suit your fancy.
Texas omelette###I ordered the Texas omelette.
###There was nothing striking about it in taste.
###Good but nothing really sticks out over other places.
pancakes,omelettes###A big strike against my overall satisfaction was lack of pancakes served with omelettes.
pancakes,omelette###Every place that I have been to for breakfast includes a stack of 2 or 3 pancakes with all omelette selections.
###For the same price of other joints I received less food and the quality was just the same.
###The waitress also failed the one test I will hold to any server: no refills on my drink.
###I will never hold meal quality against my server as it's out of their control but I do expect them to do what they can.
beverage###I don't want to ask for refills on my beverage.
###Asking the customer if they desire a refill is a standard practice.
###It's the one thing that can keep me happy even if I am left unsatisfied with my meal.
###Take US Egg or leave it.
###It's not a place I'd venture out of my way for but it's good enough that I'd drop by again if in the area.
pancakes###The best pancakes in the world!
###Great service the owners are almost always there making sure that everyone is happy and gets what they need.
###Plus free WiFi!!!
###I was so impressed with the choices!
###Just a bit of everything.
###Service was great and food was fantastic.
pancakes###Definitely hooked on the protein pancakes and will visit frequently.
###:-)
###Gluttony at its finest!
###I came here after a Saturday morning hike because I was STARVING!!!
pancakes,Bacon,skillet###I was able to order their half and half which consist of smaller two protein pancakes and half of one of their Idaho Hot Skillets so I got the Bacon, onions & peppers skillet.
pancakes###Two smaller protein pancakes my ass!!
pancakes###Those pancakes were HUGE!
pancakes###If those are the small pancakes, then I would hate to see what the regular size look like.
###Not that I am complaining at all lol.
###Seriously though, it was good.
coffee###Like another reviewer said, it was hard to get a refill on drinks and all I had was coffee and water.
coffee pot###Now don't get me wrong, they do leave the coffee pot on your table, but can a girl get some extra water?
###Please?
###But other than that, I will definitely be back, post hike of course :)
###I went to US twice, and wanted to wait until my 2nd time to give it a review.
###We initially went when it first opened it's Greenway location.
###Since I wasn't happy that time, I chalked it up to opening weekend issues.
###Our 2nd try was definitely 100 times better.
###Super nice service and it was packed..we had about a 10 min wait time on a Sunday morning.
chalk###Coffee was good and the portions are huge...service was slow, but again, I chalk it up to every single table being occupied.
###Will definitely go back..the hashbrowns were awesome!
###Great Bfast!
###Good Service!
###Will be returning!
###I was disapointed in the breakfast served at my hotel, so went yelping for an alternative.
###USE is definitely worth the bit of a drive to get there!
pancakes,skillet###I got the half and half combo of protein pancakes and Santa Fe skillet.
pancakes###If those are "small" pancakes, the regular ones must be huge!
skillet###The skillet was a bit different style than I've had before, with the egg on top rather than scrambled in, but it works.
###The service was very good too.
###Definitely one to remember!
###I'm usually here for breakfast every Sunday.
###The food is fantastic (try the protein pancakes packed with blueberries and granola), the service is quick and friendly, and the owner is always there making sure his customers are happy.
###Not the fanciest place, but the food more than makes up for it.
###Great prices, and great food.
###Good breakfast joint.
pancake###They have all the basics plus the catchy protein pancake.
blueberries,blueberry muffins###It is good but I'd like fresh blueberries in it, not the canned kind like when you make blueberry muffins.
###Yummy food and friendly wait staff.
###I've never had to wait for a table even during brunch on the weekends.
###:)
Protein pancakes###Protein pancakes good.
skillet###Not fan of the Idaho skillet though.
###Prices may be a little high compared to Ihop and Village Inn.
###Menu is quite varied.
###Decor is pleasant.
###the place was full on a Sunday morning when we went.
###Family owned and operated in AZ since 1991.
###Have other locations around the valley too.
###Typical diner food.
###Again to be fair, as a vegetarian, my choices on the menu are quite limited.
###Food is awesome.
###I went to the u.s egg this morning and ordered the half order deal.
protein pancakes,vegi Idaho skillet###I got the protein pancakes with vegi Idaho skillet.
###SOoo yummy!
###i ate it all.
Idaho skillet,potato pieces,brown,spinach,tomato,bell pepper###The Idaho skillet had little potato pieces with hash-brown, mushrooms, spinach, tomato, onion and bell pepper.
###Ordered my egg over easy (cooked perfect) so the egg yoke could drip over it.
###Mixed it all up and it was a feast.
pancakes###The pancakes made me feel like I was being bad.
mixture###They had a mixture of flavor, sweet and soft.
###They melted in my mouth.
orange juice###The orange juice had a slight amount of pulp, which is my fave.
###you can tell its fresh.
###As a vegetarian, I saw many options I could eat.
Benedict,waffles,pancakes,skillet###Almost ever section of the menu had a vegetarian option, omelets, eggs Benedict, waffles, pancakes, the Idaho skillet as I got, and so on.The menu is huge.
###The server hinted on what I should order.
###My boyfriend ordered the hawk eye egg omelet, it was light and fluffy, and the eggs themselves tasted like an array of wonderfull cheese.
###Our server, Hillary, was very friendly and got right down to business.
###I will ask for her every time, she really cares about her job and it shows.
###I will be back very soon.
###This place rocks!
###Cute and small with amazing food.
###I was here a few days ago and found the prices reasonable, the atmosphere homey and the food amazing!
###Can't get much better.
###The food was great and the service was fast and friendly.
half skillet###We had the half skillet and basic breakfast.
###Everything was delicious.
###The owner, Mario, came by ask us if everything was fine.
###I think this is one of the best breakfast places in Phoenix and we have tried a bunch of them.
###This restaurant is simply one of the best breakfast restaurants in town.
###US Egg has great pricing, amazing food, and a super friendly staff.
###We've been eating here for years and have never had a bad experience.
pancakes,omelette###My husband will tell you to try the pancakes, I'll tell you to try an omelette.
###Either way, I'm pretty sure you win.
###First time here cause i thought it was a gourmet place.
meat skillet,spinach###Had a meat skillet, GF had spinach, mushroom omelet.
###Minus one star cause my eggs were a little well.
###Other than that my mouth is watering anticipating a return visit.
turchino coffee###The turchino coffee is great.
pancakes###The wife loves the protein pancakes and we make a special trip to this side of town just for them.
###Good service and good food.
###No substitutions allowed for anything.
pork###I don't eat pork and wasn't allowed to sub for anything.
gravy###Then I asked for gravy and the waitress said they don't have any.
gravy###No gravy at a breakfast joint?
###Then the service wasn't good either.
###I pretty much sat most of the time waiting to get silverware, or syrup.
###Won't go back.
###Delicious and nice.
###I've tried many places for breakfast, and I always end up back at US Egg.
pancakes,burrito###My favorites are the half and half - love the protein pancakes, and the breakfast burrito.
###The owner stops by every time I go to say hello and  make sure everything's okay.
###Even when it's busy.
###The lunch items are just fine, too.
###First time at U.S Egg.
###We had a very enjoyable experience.
###Place was packed upon arrival but we were greeted warmly by the hosts and assured it was only going to be few minutes.
###We were promptly seated well within ten minutes.
###Given the crowd, I expected delays in service but that didn't happen.
###While being led to our seat we were greeted immediately, with a smile, by our server Amber.
###She quickly took our drink order.
###The food was delicious.
###I really enjoyed the Gentlemen Jim's Omelette that had an outstanding sauce on it.
###The restaurant was perfectly staffed.
###Our waitress was prompt and friendly.
###The breakfast was really good.
###Great for people watching too.
###I really can't think of any reason not to give U.S. Egg five stars.

###The food and service could not be better.
###There were 5 of us dining today.
###Everyone was very pleased.
###The owner, Mario, welcomes you at the door.
###I highly recommend.
###The owner must be watching Restaurant Stakeout.
###Willy Degel would be proud!!
###We went there for the first time last weekend.
###We were immediately greated by a very friendly hostess and also the manager.
###We were immediately seated on the patio.
###It was a hazy morning and it reminded me of being in San Diego with their little green area off the patio.
###Our waitress Jenny was so helpful wiht the menue and knew exactly what to suggest to newcomers.
###We ordered soft drinks and she brought a whole pitcher.
###How smart is that?
###Saving time not running back and forth for refills equals efficiency and happy customers.
protien pancakes,skillet###We had the protien pancakes which are amazing and the skillet which is equally fantastic.
###Neither of us could finish our plates.
###This place is awesome.
###Always consistent...great meal..great service.
pancakes###Hawkeye with protein pancakes is a winner.
blueberry###The food was great, especially the blueberry pancakes.
###I think we got a new waitress and she was a little chatty but did a great job at serving us.
###One of the better breakfast places I've been to.
###The menu is HUGE and service was on point.
###I like that it's not a huge chain so there's nore of a "hometown" feel.
###It gets really busy during the weekend mornings especially, but the bar is open seating...
protein pancakes###Best protein pancakes!
pancakes###i ALWAYS get the half and half (chicken, bacon, avocado skillet) with protein pancakes!
###AMAZING every time!!!
###Love this place!

###The service is fast they people are friendly and it is a very nice atmosphere.
###Check this place out.
Protein pancakes###Protein pancakes are unique and delicious, place gets busy but service is great.
###Good Breakfast House.
###I had the Breakfast Sandwich: Add Avocado and onion and it's great.
###Service was very mechanical...not all that friendly, but, the overall experience was good enough to keep it at 5 stars.
pancake###I was told that they have some way out pancake meals.
###Sounded interesting for those that like to explore new frontiers.
###Nice breakfast place.
###The service was good and the food was nice.
###The last couple of times I've been here the place was busy but food always came and our waiter always managed to check on us so I'm impressed with the really good service.
###My husband and I tried this place one morning looking for somewhere new to us.
###We were pleasantly surprised by how much we liked it.
protein pancakes###The protein pancakes are my new craving!
###Love them!
###The only reason I didn't give the final star is only because seating at this location is a little weird.
###Our second time we were seated right next to the kitchen door where my husband could watch everything.
###He didn't enjoy that.
###The food however has been great each time!
###If you're looking for somewhere to go I highly recommend this place.
###It gets busy so go early!
pancakes###Awesome food love the protein pancakes and great service.
###definitely a must go for breakfast.
###Expect to leave full with generous portions.
###Packed on a Saturday morning but people were being seated quickly so that's good.
###Five stars easy
###Fast service, hot food, beautiful presentation!
benedict###Loved the egg's benedict california style.
###This place is always busy, so they must be doing something right.
protein pancakes###The protein pancakes are to die for.
###Service is quick and friendly.
###Food is always delicious too.
pancakes###the best pancakes
###One of my favorite breakfast spots in the North Phoenix area.
###I come here often with friends for lunch and breakfast.
Devil###My personal favorite is the Sun Devil omelet.
###It's so good and so flavorful.
###Ingredients are always fresh and the food is always filling while being very affordable.
###There are so many reasons I love U.S. Egg on Greenway.
###There may be a slight wait to get a table but once seated the restaurant is well staffed with attentive servers.
###I've never felt neglected while eating there.
###Food is excellent.
mushroom###I had the Gentlemen Jim's Famous Omelette with the outstanding mushroom sauce and it was delicious.
###The fact that the place is always busy even into mid morning is a testament of how good the food and service are.
###A very well run restaurant.
###If you want a delicious, filling, affordable breakfast, this is where you go.
meat###I've ordered way too many meat lovers scrambles since I discovered this place, and every time i get one it's so good that I can't stop eating until it looks like a scene from man vs food.
Protein pancakes,pancakes I've###Protein pancakes are some of the best pancakes I've had too.
Meat,skillet,pork,chicken fried steak###Awesome Breakfast!!! Had the Meat Lovers skillet and it was so hearty and was a huge portion of pork lovin plus the chicken fried steak!
hash browns,hash browns###Very picky about my hash browns but theses hash browns were perfect, not overly salty or to dark, but perfectly balanced.
###Server was attentive and the restaurant was nice and clean.
###Definitely coming back!!!
###Food is always good, the service is hit or miss.
###Fast seating, clean, and good prices.
###Went to US Egg for a change up from the hotel breakfast as eating the same breakfast for 6 days straight did get tiresome even though it was great each day.
coffee###Well...we should have maybe made it 7 days at the hotel, the service and food were mediocre but the coffee was awful.
coffee###By no means are we Starbucks people and usually find better coffee at smaller diners but was sure wrong on this one.
chicken###The menu did allow us to try chicken and waffles but even that was pretty standard.
###Came in around 9:45 am on a Sunday & though there was a wait it was less then 10 minutes which was nice since I was starving.
Meat Lovers Skillet,hash browns,sausage,ham,bacon,steak###I had the Meat Lovers Skillet which was hash browns topped with cheese, egg, sausage, ham, bacon, & a country fried steak & gravy.
###It was DELICIOUS!!! & huge.
###I was only able to eat about half.
###I will definitely be returning.
###Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because our waitress wasn't the best.
orange juice###She never asked my husband if he wanted more orange juice which he finished before his dish got there.
###Luckily he had water.
###Other then that though, it was a good experience.
###What can I say about a restaurant that serves the most popular breakfast foods?
###Well I'll start with the service.
###The owner is outright an awesome host.
###He gave us the best server "Emily" that any establishment could ever have as a server.
###She alone made my Phoenix morning.
###I wish we could have more "professional" servers like her in California.
###Now the food.
pancakes###Best pancakes ever.
###I repeat.
pancakes###The best pancakes ever.
protein pancakes###Just give the protein pancakes a try.
pancakes###Any version of the protein pancakes are awesome.
bacon,candy###The bonus is the bacon "AKA breakfast candy".
###When I come back, I'll come back every time.
###We had been here before it was US Egg and it was awful!
###We tried it today after Easter service with my mother and it was terrific.
protein pancake###I had the high protein pancake (half order) and it was great.
corned beef###My mom's corned beef hash was good - a large serving.
###The hubby's omelet was a good serving and fresh.
coffee###The coffee was not swell but the food made up for it.
###Nice friendly staff and great service.
###It was a Sunday afternoon at about 10:30 AM (as I call it, the breakfasting hour...er...half hour).
###I had 12...TWELVE...hungry family members visiting  me from out of town.
###Half wanted to cook breakfast at my house.
###The rest were ambivalent.
###After whiffing on lunch the previous day (see my scathing review of Harold's Corral), I needed a place to come through.
###Enter U.S. Egg.
###I'd long been a fan of their Tempe location, but service can vary greatly from one branch to the next.
###I called and got the owner.
###He said it was his busiest time of day but once we arrived he could seat us in approximately 10 minutes.
###He kept his word.
###The service was fast and efficient, if not overly friendly (hence the 4 stars instead of 5).
Texan omelette###My Texan omelette was hearty and satisfying.
pancakes###The rest of my family raved about the protein pancakes, and they were very accommodating to my gluten-free sister.
###All 12 of us left in a wonderful food coma.
###Having failed spectacularly the previous day to find a decent brunch spot, I needed to find a place to deliver me from the harsh judgement of my siblings regarding my ability to pick local restaurants.
###U.S. Egg saved my ass.
###Bravo.
###The owner, Mario, (for lack of better wording) sucks.
###He is rude and assumes the worst from people.
###That being said, good place to enjoy food, but I'll never go back because of the way he treated me and other people.
###All he cares about is money.
###Great service, great menu, fast and friendly service as well as affordable.
pancake,pancake###Tried the protein pancake on recommendation from a great friend she was right best pancake I have ever had bar none!
###If you love breakfast this is where you should be give it a try, you will see me here again and again.
###I've been to this place 5 or 6 times now in the last 3 months and for good reason, the food is awesome!
burgers###I've sampled some of the burgers and they have been unique and tasty every time.
###I never (neeever!)
chili###Order a chili burger but their's had fries in it so I had to try it.
###It did not disappoint!
###They aren't as cheap as if you we're going to Denny's but it's worth the price and the basic breakfast platter is a steal at $8.
bacon I've###They have some of the best bacon I've ever had.
pancakes,granola,blueberries###The last time I went I tried one of their famous protein pancakes, with granola, and blueberries, and it was sooo good!
blueberries,pancakes###I don't even like blueberries in my pancakes!
skillet,pancakes###You even have your choice of ordering half of one of their yummy skillet breakfasts with a protein pancakes which let me tell you is the best of everything.
###It's $10 and some change but worth it and very filling.
###This is making my mouth water.
###Looking forward to my next visit!
###A great find nearby and certainly worth the trip.
power pancake###I had the power pancake which was huge and filling and definitely worth trying as stated on the menu.
bacon###A side of bacon with that proved to be filling enough to get me through the day.
###Hubby went with his standard omelet, of cheese.
hash browns###Nothing too thrilling but he did say the hash browns were under seasoned which is a big no no in both of our books.
###Seems like a family place and overall a good experience.
###Love US Egg! My dad and I go once a month!
chicken fried steak###Usually have an omelet but have had chicken fried steak as well as the BLT.
###Always friendly and wanting to go back!
###Food is great!
###This place recently opened near my house, and I love good breakfast food, so I was hoping for it to be excellent.
###The first thing I noticed when being seated was that the silverware at our table wasn't entirely clean.
###Not a good start.
###Overall there weren't too many people in the restaurant (4 or 5 tables while I was there), and there seemed to be quite a few servers.
###Our drink order was taken quickly, but took a while to fill.
coffee###I got a coffee, and asked for cream when it came out, which also took longer than I would have expected to get.
beef,sausage,corned beef###I ordered "Corned beef hash", and when the food came out, they brought me a "Corn huskers", which is apparently another dish with sausage instead of corned beef.
###They took the dish back to resolve the issue and apologized for the mistake.
sausage,corned beef###When it came back out, I am pretty sure they just exchanged the sausage with corned beef on the plate, but since part of the dish was eggs over easy, by this time the eggs were cold.
toast###The dish came with toast, which did not come out with it (Even with the delay), and I feel like if I didn't remind the server, I would not have gotten (Although I could be wrong).
corned beef###There was also hashbrowns and the corned beef.
###Neither were bad per-say, but they were both definitely on the bland side.
###I feel like each of the issues I had with this place were small, and could have easily been overlooked on its own (Except maybe the bland food, but I could have tried something different).
###The problem was that there were just SO many of them.
###The one redeeming factor about the place was that everyone was very friendly.
###When the one redeeming factor about a place is not the food, it is hard to justify giving it another try :(.
###Another location of this restaurant chain has gotten some good press in the newspaper recently, so when this location opened, I was eager to try it.
###Overall I was dissapointed and won't be going back.
coffee###Their real coffee is weakish and slightly acidic.
decaf coffee,coffee###Their decaf coffee was better but also weak.
###Eggs are pale and bland.
###Hash Browns have nice appearance but are also bland.
###On the bright side, Biscuits and Gravy are good, with buiscuits being fluffy (a rarity).
###Service is excellent and the atomosphere of the place is nice and bright.
###I'm dying for another good local breakfast place in Chandler.
###I had high hopes for US Egg, but I can't recommend it.
coffee###The food was bland(not in a good way) coffee was weak and the service was slow.
###I'm sticking with The Good Egg or 24 Carrots.
###Even Mimi's is better (I'm not a fan of large corporate restaurants).
###Living in Ahwatukee there are not many places for a good traditional breakfast.
Crackers###IHOP, Denny's, Crackers (Tried to kill us literally) so I am setting my bar low.
###I have been in three times and all three were pleasant experiences.
pancakes###The first time I ordered OJ and the protein pancakes.
###The OJ was not fresh but it was fine.
protein pancakes###The protein pancakes were excellent.
###Service was slow for the drinks but fast for the food.
###Everything was warm and cooked well.
toast###The second time I went with two friends and ordered the two eggs breakfast with wheat toast.
###The eggs were perfectly cooked as were the hashbrowns.
###Both could have used some more salt and pepper but I was able to add that.
###Service was good, a little slow but manageable.
###The last time I went with my two kids and husband.
###I ordered the same breakfast as above and it was good.
###The place is brand new and clean.
###My biggest complaint is the uniforms.
###I am all for trendy but the tight.
###short shorts need to go.
apron###My waitress shorts should not be shorter than her apron.
###Jeans would be much more professional.
###Compared to my others options this one is rated on top.
###Also the last two times I have gone the place has been crowded.
###I think they are working out the kinks of being new and this will be a good breakfast place.
###My mother and I went to this new location to celebrate her birthday.
###We frequently eat at the location on Mill and Baseline to celebrate various holidays with family.
easter###i.e. birthdays, graduation, easter, etc.
###The location off of Mill is quite small so we were excited to see how open and modern this new location was designed.
###Upon arrival, we were greeted cheerfully and seated right away.
###Our server was very friendly and chatty, but in a good way.
beverages###She took our drink orders right away and brought us back out beverages and pitchers to refill our drinks as we please.
pumpkin waffles,california benedict###We ordered pumpkin waffles and the california benedict.
pumpkin waffle###The pumpkin waffle was heaven on earth!
whipped cream###I recommend opting for whipped cream with no syrup.
###You won't be disappointed!
california benedict###And as usual, the california benedict was amazing.
benedict,bacon###It's eggs benedict with bacon, avocado and tomato... so flipping good.
###At the end of the meal, the server even offered to-go cups for drinks.
###I always think this is a nice gesture.
###I will certainly be coming back to this location and would recommend giving it a shot.
###I had not gone out for breakfast in a long time it seemed...
###So I knew this spot had just opened and wanted check it out.
###I arrived to a really busy restaurant and was seated pretty fast...
###I was greeted by my server Sam with a smile plus she was really helpful with giving me tips on what to order.
Meat Lovers Skillet half,skillet###I ended up going with the Meat Lovers Skillet half and half that means half skillet and two Protein Pancakes.
###I rate the experience as followed...
###
Meat Lovers Skillet B###Meat Lovers Skillet - B
###Protein Pancakes - B
###Service - A++
###
###I would say this is a great place to eat...
###I will be back for sure I saw other things I want to try off the menu.
###Have been eating at US Egg for the past 7 years although hadn't been there within the past 3 years until recently.
###My mom was in town from FL and we stopped in for a late breakfast - early lunch and it reminded me how much I love this place.
###The food was delicious, the service was fantastic and friendly.
###Yum!
###What a shame.
###We anxiously awaited the opening of this restaurant in our neighborhood, but have been seriously disappointed.
coffee,rancheros###On our first visit, the coffee was barely luke warm, and the huevos rancheros, which we usually go for were simply mediocre.
skillets###On our second visit, i tried one of the skillets.
sausage###The sausage they used was sliced up cheap links, and the potatoes they used were the frozen shredded variety.
###It would be hard for me to even rate the meal mediocre.
###Sorry to say it's two strikes and yer out for me.
###There are way too many other very good breakfast options nearby.
###There are much better options for breakfast than this place.
###The food is ok but lacked salt.
###So if you are going for a low sodium diet you are all set.
###My first visit was fine nothing special would have given it a 3.
###I would recommend not going in after 1PM.
###I went in at 1:30pm and there was nobody there to seat me as they were chatting at a table off to the side.
###I was seated after a few minutes, when he noticed I was waiting.
###The booth where I was seated didn't seem to have a waitress assigned to it...  Everyone was clearing tables and huddled in the back.
###I waited 10 Minutes then decided they wanted to close so I left and went to get food elsewhere.
###My wife and I had to try it and so we did.
###Nice waitress named Savana.
###We ordered and got the food VERY fast BUT it was bordering on cold and we told her that it could certainly be warmer.
###The "stuff" for the omelet was not cooked into the eggs and was cold.
wife's bacon###My wife's bacon was cold and greasy.
tomatoes###I had sliced tomatoes that were very hard and I had to use a knife to cut them.
coffee###The coffee was barely warm.
###VERY expensive--the bill for 2 of us was $27.38.
###I paid the waitress $33 and we left.
###WE WILL NOT BE BACK!
###Bob Stephens
###My husband and I had breakfast here about a month ago and now that I am sitting down to do the review I find that neither of us can remember what we ate or how the service was or anything remarkable about the experience at all.
###It was completely forgettable.
###If you like generic chain restaurant breakfasts, then this place is for you.
pancakes,skillet###Got the Half & Half with protein pancakes and meat lovers skillet.
###A good amount of food and it was decent.
protein pancakes standout###I think the protein pancakes standout as being on of the better items on the menu.
###Not a cheap place to go for breakfast though.
###Pros:
###English Muffin: super delicious, warm and moist
spinach###Eggs with spinach: very good, flavorful
###Coffee: fragrant and tasty
###
###Cons:
###Hashed Potatoes: bland
pasty###Chili: too thick, too salty, rather pasty
###Wait: very, very long
###Service: a little slow
###
###Conclusion: 3
###I love the US Egg - but the service at this location is AWFUL!!
###I have been going to the Tempe location for the last 15 years and it is a well oiled machine...
###The food is perfect and the service is awesome!!
###The new Chandler location has just as good as food, but after we got seated we waited 30 minutes to order and then we waited another 30 minutes to get out order (for two people).
###After we were done eating we didn't see our server for another 20 minutes until we had to stop her as she was walking by and request our bill.
###You may want to wait a few months until the service improves, go to the Tempe location in the mean time.
hash browns###I didn't think it was possible to mess up eggs or hash browns until I ate here.
scrambled eggs###My scrambled eggs were chewy, how does that happen?
hash browns###And the hash browns were barely cooked, so the result was a pile of mush on my plate, not even slightly crispy.
###The entire menu is pricey, especially for the poor quality of food.
###Over 20 bucks for 2 people, just entrées, not even a drink.
###This place is always busy, which I don't understand because their food sucks.
###They told us 10 minutes, and 25 minutes later we were seated.
###It took forever for our waitress to come and take our order and for our food to come out.
###I am giving them 2 stars because my husband did enjoy the Idaho Hot Skillet of the Half & Half.
pancakes###He didn't like the other half, which was pancakes.
skillet###If it wasn't for the skillet, I would have given them only 1 star.
###Terrible restaurant!
###Out waitress was not friendly and didn't check on us.
###All the staff looks miserable.
###You expect more from a new restaurant.
###Food comes and it's cold.
###The potatoes weren't cooked, sent the food back they offered to remake it but choose not to eat.
coffee###Tasted terrible anyways... Asked for more coffee and the waitress threw it on the table.
###That's when I had enough and went and got the manager.
###I'm sitting here in the restaurant writing this because it was that bad!
###We should have walked out when we walked in because we heard one of the employees apologizing to someone on the phone.
browns###Worst breakfast place!!! Cold hash browns, not cooked eggs(how can someone messed up these?) bad service.
###Waited for half an hour for our food!
###This is our first and last in this stupid place!
###Went with the girl's book club (ie.
###wine club.. hehe) for brunch today.
###Good thing one of the gals had made reservations for our party of 9 because this place was SUPER busy and crowded on late Sunday morning.
###This is a new place to the area, so there were a lot of expectations with the new place.
###Here's what went down:
###
coffee,creamer###Our server was a nice, young gal that seemed overwhelmed with our group - we kept having to ask her and then ask again for things like coffee, coffee mugs, creamer, pens for the check, etc.
coffee mugs,coffee,coffee###I was baffled by their so-called coffee mugs - I swear the damn thing could only contain 5oz of coffee!!  Everytime you sipped, you had to refill.. oh, and why would you serve a table of 9 only ONE CARAFE of coffee when they're clearly drinking through that stuff and keep asking for refills?
###That boggled me!
coffee###To make it worse, we realized cups of coffee were over 2 dollars each!  Really?
brew###This was not some kind of Organic, Fair-Trade Starbucks brew, this was US Egg.. give me a break.
apples,chicken###I had the Scottsdale Salad (yeah, I know, what a dumb name) which was actually very tasty: perfect amount of well cooked onions, apples, and chicken over Spinach.
###I did see a lot of empty plates, but didn't hear too many praises, so I'm not sure what to report on that.
###Overall, the service gal was nice but not very functional at her job; the food I had was tasty, plentiful, but I can't review their 'breakfast items' at this point (I may have to come again).
###The place is well decorated, new, and hoppin', so I'm saying I could give it another shot .. it was not a bad experience as a whole.
###I've been to this location a few times now and I plan on going back again and again.
###Contrary to prior reviews I have always received excellent service!
###The young ladies that wait tables here are beautiful as well as extremely sweet and attentive.
###I always feel like I'm an old family friend when I come here.
###I've had the opportunity to try quite a few dishes here.
breakfast sandwich,fruit###The breakfast sandwich with a side of fruit is delicious!
bacon###It is a generous amount of fresh food for under $10! (the fruit isn't even cut until I order it)  I've also had the traditional breakfast with eggs, hashbrowns and bacon.
###When I first read the reviews about the hashbrowns not being crispy I was shocked, maybe a simple remedy for the other customers could be to simply ask for "crispy hashbrowns" as I did and they would be more than happy with their outcome.
###I've also enjoyed the ever popular half and half.
half skillet###This is a small (but still generous) stack of their famous protein pancakes (blueberry, granola, cinnamon and almonds) and a half skillet of your choice.
ham,sausage,ham,sausage###I chose the ham, sausage and mushroom skillet, the ham is diced and thick, the sausage juicy and the mushrooms lightly sauteed with a layer of hashbrowns at the bottom.
pancakes###I like to switch it up with the half and half and get strawberry pancakes from time to time at no charge!
###I honestly don't understand why this place doesn't have five stars!
###I'm baffled.
###The managers are also so attentive, I've seen them checking on every table in the place, which gives you ample opportunity to speak up if your food ie: hashbrowns or eggs are not to your liking.
###I'm sure they'd be more than happy to improve your experience.
###Seriously people speak up and stop being so picky!
pancakes###Only love the pancakes there.
###Went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't insanely busy.
###My group sat in a booth near the kitchen, where there was also an exit outside.
###Halfway through our meal someone on staff decided to prop the exit door open so the 100+ heat could make our meal very uncomfortable.
###The waitress was inattentive and didn't make enough stops to check on us or our drink levels and took excessively long when bringing anything back.
###The food was pretty good, but the total experience was negative.
###8/5/12
###
###Checked in at door.
###Packed.
###Told 10 minutes???  Waited 20.
###Left when it became apparent it would be longer.
###The poor reviews I was reading on Yelp at time didn't help.
###Tip to hostess, be honest about wait time.
###Keep in mind that I drank quite a bit the night before...
###
coffee###the coffee is the standard swill that you'll find in any diner,
###we had to bug the waitress a few times for water, yet
Frittata###I felt like a new man after that Arizona Frittata.
pancakes,fruit###I love coming here for brunch they have the best protein pancakes and you can add fruit to them... yum heaven!
###They have a huge menu so sometimes it takes a while to decide I think that's my only issue is there are so many choices... but I'm really not complaining.
###The prices are very fair and the food is really good as well as the service.
###If coming here on weekends  be prepared to wait but totally worth it in my opinion!
###Try the Hawkeye Omelet.
###It is delicious!
###Breakfast the way it was meant to be!
skillets,Protein pancakes###The skillets are AMAZING!! Protein pancakes are to die for!
###They have a gluten-free menu (which allows for a LOT of variety), and always cater to my dietary needs.
###Staff is always friendly.
###Weekends can get busy, but the food is well worth the wait!
coffee###Absolutely horrible coffee.
muffin,sausage###I ordered their traditional breakfast: 2 eggs, hashbrowns, muffin and added sausage.
sausage###All were decent except the sausage.
###It tasted like it was freshly microwaved from the freezer.
###Scenery: about what you'd expect, plain, looks like any other breakfast nook.
###The only thing notable was the very attractive female servers dressed as cowgirls.
###Considering it's close to Halloween, I'm not sure if that's part of their regular attire though.
###The service was efficient and pleasant enough.
###For the price you pay and quality of food, you'd be better served by hitting the ihop up the street.
power pancakes###Try the power pancakes.
###Deeelicious!!!
###
###i'm not sure if this is under new management since the previous reviews or what, but the service was fantastic, the staff was exceptionally attentive, the food was great and...well, i just have to say that the waitresses are equally as attractive as they are friendly.
###typically i'm against "chain" type restaurants, but this restaurant (this one in particular, likely) will be on my list to visit again.
###Went on a Sunday morning at 8 am with my hubby.
###Greeted by everyone on the staff with smiles and headed back to be seated.
###When they started to direct us to seats by the kitchen and I said "not over there", they happily seated us in a booth.
###The service was excellent at that time in the morning.
###The food was not so excellent.
corned beef###I had the Denver omelet and my hubby had corned beef hash.
hash browns,muffin###The breakfasts come with hash browns and a toasted, already buttered English muffin.
hash browns###However, the hash browns tasted like they were prepared in a large batch and kept in a warming pan until served.
###They were not particularly tasty and lacked the flavorful crunchiness of freshly cooked potatoes.
green peppers,ham###The omelet was just okay, nothing special with crunchy green peppers and sauteed onions, diced ham inside.
###There was a small amount of cheese on the top, but noticeably lacking inn the interior.
corned beef,tomatoes###My hubby commented that  the corned beef has could have been more appealing, but enjoyed the fresh tomatoes served with the meal.
###I don't know if it is the glass/plastic serving plates they used, but the food was cold before we were half way through it.
###They might want to consider placing the hot food on plates that hold the heat a little bit better.
coffee,coffee###I have to agree with another reviewer regarding the coffee cup size and the coffee, but at least it was hot and the carafe left on the table was enough for the two of us.
###The restaurant was filling rather quickly, but still no one waiting in line at 8:40 when we left.
###Thumbs up for the service.
###Needs improvement for the food.
coffee###At $25 for the two meals and 2 cups of coffee, we probably will look for another place for better food.
###just ok....
###My wife and I went here this morning.
###It was early, 7 am, and we got seated very quickly.
###There was a lot to choose from on the menu so it took us a bit to decide.
###We placed our order, and about the time we wondered what was taking so long our food came out.
Chicken Waffles,Benedict###I ordered the Chicken & Waffles, my wife had the California Benedict.
###We were both pleased with the way our food was prepared.
###It was clearly freshly made and not sitting around waiting for us to show up (i.e.
###McDonald's).
###It is a clean restaurant, well lit with very clean restrooms.
###The only thing that wasn't pleasant about the atmosphere was the music, a little too loud and Country.
###However if you like Country (we don't), it'll be great for you.
###Overall it was a great place, and we would go there again.
###Even though the food is a bit on the more pricey side.
###I hope you find this review helpful.
###This place was just built walking distance to my house, so I've been dying to check it out.
###Although, to be honest, I've been to US Eggs before and they were just fine... just a good ol' breakfast place.
###After perusing the menu, I noticed that their Protein Pancakes had a star next to them, showing that they were a specialty.
###Then I noticed that even the t-shirts on the waitstaff mentioned their Protein Pancakes.
###You know what this means?! I'm SO ordering some Protein Pancakes!
###And wowzer, was that a FANTASTIC idea!
###These things were amazing.
###There was no protein powdery mix in these!
blueberries,pancake###Fresh blueberries, almonds and oatmeal mixed with some pancake mix of sorts.
###De-lish!
###Definitely worth the trip just for those babies!
###My family and I were here for Sunday brunch celebrating my birhday.
###At first, I thought breakfast joint + Sunday morning = long wait, but that was not the case.
###Despite the place having a pretty decent sized crowd as expected, the four of us were seated pretty quickly and because of the fast service as well we were in and out in no time!
###The menu is pretty large and gives you a lot to choose from, but we were all starving so we actually got things figured out pretty quickly.
pancakes,bacon###My dad got some 'hungry man' breakfast, my sister and mom both got the Italy Omelette, and I got a build-your-own type breakfast with pancakes, bacon, and eggs.
###Our waitress was extremely attentive, everytime we needed a refill on our drinks she was all over it, we never had the chance to get thirsty.
###The food came out fairly quickly (I'd say about 20-25 minutes, not bad for four meals) and they were very accomodating for my other sister that arrived as the rest of us finished our meal.
chocolate chip###Food was great, I got the chocolate chip pancakes and they were perfectly protioned for my liking.
eggs bacon###Not too big, but filling nonetheless and the eggs & bacon were cooked well and fresh.
###Everyone else at my table loved our food, and seeing as this was my second successful trip to US Egg I think it's safe to say I will be back again!
breakfast burrito,burrito###I ordered the breakfast burrito, which was delivered very quickly, but it was only lukewarm and had obviously been prepared well in advance because the burrito was wet on the bottom from having sat in the frig for a long period.
hash browns###The hash browns were cold and soggy as well, very disappointing.
###Great food, and a few unique dishes.
chicken###My fav is the Dan Marjerle omelet, chicken, avacado is delicious.
###One of my top 2-3 breakfast spots in the east valley.
###Love this place!
###Serves great breakfast, and fast friendly service!
###Its all rite I guess, good location, fairly decent menu and the order came promptly and was as the menu described.
###two things they can work on.
coffee###1.  get better coffee.
coffee###the price of coffee does not justify the taste of this semi-bitter black liquid.
###get some cartel or something.
###2.  turn down the music a little, i dun mind country music, but not so loud and early in the morning !
###:)
###
###come here if u are on chandler and need a bite.
cracker###its got a faster moving wait list than cracker barrel on the other side of the 10.
###Horrible food and the guys on the street corner spinning the signs...annoying and over the top.
###I see now why they need sign spinners in your face to get you to their location.
###Never again!
###I drive past US Egg every day and always wanted to try it.
###Finally got the chance to stop by this weekend.
###The food was spectacular and the service even more so.
skillet,hash browns,pancakes###I had the half-and-half breakfast with a chicken/bacon/avocado skillet on top of hash browns topped with an egg over easy, and 2 "small" pancakes (1 chocolate chip and had to try 1 protein pancake, their specialty) ps.
###They're actually not that small.
###Overall great experience, DELICIOUS food, and at a very reasonable price (less than $10!).
###I will be definitely coming back every weekend.
###I think I found my new breakfast spot!
###Plenty of good for the price, and great customer service!
bacon###I've been there twice in a couple weeks already, can't get enough of the bacon skillet!
###Sorry good egg but its over!
###Super service and great food.
skillet,pancakes###I tried the half and half with a chicken/avocado skillet and protein pancakes.
###DELICIOUS.
###Will be back next week.
###Great place for breakfast.
###Pros: Good size servings, reasonable prices, very friendly staff, prompt service, good atmosphere, great for families.
Cons coffee###Cons: coffee is not that great.
###The food is tasty.
omelettes,browns,chicken fried steak,pancake,florentine###What we've tried that's good: omelettes, hash browns, chicken fried steak,  protein pancake,  eggs florentine.
orange juice###The orange juice is fresh and tasty.
corn###The only thing we didn't like that much is the corn beef hash; not that great.
###Definitely will be coming back .
skillet###Ordered the half and half with the sante fe skillet.
skillet,protein pancakes###The skillet was okay, but the protein pancakes were better.
###Tasty and cooked well.
###Our original waitress was very rude, condescending when we had questions about our orders and said to my mom "you're killing me."
###After we told the manager, he switched our waiter..
###She was exceptional.
###As for the ambience, very open and spacious, with light background music.
###No wait at all at prime lunch time hours on a Saturday!
###They also have a nice outdoor patio..
###1st trip about 2 months ago was pretty good.
###Was there again today and service was poor.
ham,browns,muffins###Ordered eggs over medium, were served like they were hockey pucks...told the waitress and she said she would get new eggs for us, but left the our plates on the table for the next 10 minutes letting the ham, hash browns and English muffins get cold.
###Why would they NOT put the plates back under the warmer in the kitchen until the eggs were ready?
###Manager came over and said she understood the eggs were made incorrectly, I asked her why they would leave our plates on the table...she said 'sorry' and that was it.
###Did not offer to offset the bill, nothing, nada, zippo - so I just had to limit my tip and left a note on the receipt saying "Cold food today - not good".
###How do you screw up eggs?
###Ask US Egg....very disappointing.
###The service is excellent and the menu is extensive.
chicken fried steak###The chicken fried steak is delicious.
Bloody###They also serve mixed drinks like Bloody Mary's and Mimosas which is a nice touch.
###Loose the annoying, driver distracting sign spinner at the freeway!!!  He's going to get someone KILLED!!!
###I will never eat here BECAUSE of him!
skillets,pancakes,omelettes###Great food -- the skillets, protein pancakes and omelettes are among the best.
###Service is good -- they help each other out and know their menu well.
###I'd highly recommend it.
###It gets busy on the weekends but worth the wait.
###Food here is very good.
bacon,skillet,pancakes###I had something called the half-in-half, I think, which consisted of a bacon and onion skillet and the protein pancakes.
###OMG THE PROTEIN PANCAKES.
###Seriously, these things are awesome.
granola###Made with granola and berries and all sorts of things, they are filling and tasty and everyone going to US Egg should try them.
###Delicious!
###Service could have been a bit better, but all in, I was very pleased.
###Called the Chandler PD about the sign spinner guy after getting nowhere talking to the manager us egg.
###This sign spinner yells a traffic, drops his sign in the roadway, holds a sign out next to traffic over the roadway, etc.
###I will NEVER go to this place!!
coffee###Great service, great food, priced a little high, and the coffee is horrible.
###They need a light breakfast blend instead of the sludge.
###Maybe I'm just not a breakfast person.
###I wasn't too impressed with lunch either.
###Food is fresh, there are healthy options.
###I'm just never blown away.
###Although I would eat here over a Denny's-like restaurant any day.
###My family stayed at the hotel next door for a week on vacation and when we saw this restaurant we wanted to try it.
###Being from the Midwest, we are accustomed to huge portions of food.
###So when our order came, we were concerned that it may not be enough.
###But surprisingly, it was just right.
###US EGG became our go to place.
###We tried other places in the area but they were so-so and ok.
###We definitely preferred US EGG.
###Now, we are back home and been to our regular breakfast place a couple of times and realized that the huge portions are overwhelming and end up feeling heavy and slow.
###We may have to find another place for breakfast now and I don't mean that in a bad way.
pancakes###BTW, the protein pancakes are awesome!
###I'm a fan now!
###After being gone for nearly two months, the far to overzealous sign spinner employed by this business IS UNFORTUNATELY BACK at 202 and Chandler and the manager of this place hung up on me when I was discussing the problem again.
dash cam videos###I guess I'll have to resort to uploading to youtube the dash-cam videos of this idiot sign spinner repeatedly dropping his sign in the street and the antics and lengths he goes to to get attention for this business which is obviously not successful enough with its existing customer base to stay in business.
###Businesses that are successful and packed do so by remembering who the customer is and providing a good product at a fair price, NOT by trying to attract so much attention that they risk causing traffic accidents and repeatedly annoy drivers to the point they call the police!
bone###The traffic accident most likely to occur is one where a driver is trying to turn the corner and is distracted by this idiot's sign or yelling and they get hit T-bone style RIGHT IN THE DRIVERS DOOR!
###I knew someone that was T-boned in the drivers side and SHE AND HER 10 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ARE DEAD!!!!!
###If you want to take back our streets from the idiot sign spinners like the one used by this business, DON'T GO THERE!!!
###I would never again think of going to this business!
###It was good.
###Loved the decor, menu had something on there for everyone.
###Wasn't knock your socks off amazing, but good enough that I'll be back.
###They have a lot of options on the menu and usually you are seated quickly.
###Their service is pushy and servers don't seem to know the menu.
###They did make mistakes to my last two orders but did try to correct them.
###Food is decent and service is average
###I've been here a few times and am never really that impressed.
###The place is always crowded and loads of diners waiting to grab a seat but I don't understand ... it must be me.
pancake###Tried the protein pancake and it wasn't cooked all the way through - the middle was still wet.
###Ick.
pancake###Flavor of the pancake was decent but nothing to rave about.
browns,waffle###One friend tried the egg breakfast - good but hash browns were undercooked and another the protein waffle - very good.
###Service is very good here and the place is clean.
###But are they hurrying with the food to seat the diners waiting?
###I don't know but I probably won't be back to find out.
###A little more then I usually spend on breakfast but the food quality is excellentand so is the service!
protein pancakes###All I have to say is, protein pancakes.
###They are seriously out of this world.
skillet,pancakes###I usually get the half and half with a skillet and the smaller version of the pancakes.
###Seriously, they can't be beat.
coffee###If you take sugar in your coffee and are into the healthier trends, they have stevia by request too!
###Lots of menu choices, and consistent quality.
###It's on my list of regular spots!
###I went to this restaurant with my wife and a friend of mine.
###The seating and service were very prompt.
###Decor was excellent.
###Coffee had a bit of a bite to it but was decent.
pancake dishes###I had one of their pancake dishes and was impressed with the quality of the food.
###They were light, fluffy, and had the right texture.
###Their eggs were very fluffy, light, and tasty.
###The server we had was very friendly and made us all feel at home.
###Her product knowledge was better than some of the waitstaff at four-star restaurants I have been to in either Chicago or Phoenix.
###Will I come back here?
###Absolutely!
###Loved this place for the price, the decor, and delicious food!
blueberry granola,wheat pancakes,chorizo plate###I got the blueberry granola whole wheat pancakes with the chorizo plate and it was so good.
###Coffee was good too!
###Eww so gross.
###Got a simple omelet that ended up being 11 bucks- salsa was gross, egg were so greasy I couldn't even eat it.
###Will not be returning.
###BreAkfast is not that hard to do.
###This restaurant is on the site of the old Good Egg, but it is night and day different from that restaurant.
###It is open and very pleasant which makes dinning here very enjoyable.
taco salad,lettuce###I haduuu the taco salad and the shell after I was done was crispy even on the bottom which means that all the excess water from the lettuce was drained off.
chorizo version###I had the chorizo version and it was delightful.
###The portion size was ample.
pancakes###The half-and-half was great it comes with smaller protein pancakes and I got the half Santa Fe omelet.
###This is the old Good Egg that got moved to Happy Valley and 39ave which is also a great place for breakfast.
###I love how they gutted this place since it was old and outdated and now it nice and new.
###I do wish they used more comfortable booths....its like sitting on a park bench.
###The food and service is great and I highly recommend the half and half!
###I own a business walking distance from this place and decided to take several employees there for breakfast this week.
###Food was as expected okay.
waffle###The real disappointment was someone from my party asked if they can switch the English Muffin for a waffle and charge us for the difference.
###The server said no.
###Not good as other places would've jumped to creating a great experience.
###As we all know business survive on repeat local business.
###We won't be back there as the customer service just wasn't there.
###I can't understand why they have 2-3 employees outside on the streets with signs to get business but once you're there they can't meet your your simple expectations.
###I mean, really?
waffle###Charge us for the freakin waffle and serve it, don't just tell us no.
###The breakfast here was really good and actually on the healthier side.
###It appears that they are making an effort to make a delicious lighter option.
###It was extremely clean, our waitress was very friendly and fast, and on a Sunday morning at 9:30 am we only waited 5 minutes.
###Best part - no screaming children (which is the reason we avoid IHOP at all costs).
protein pancakes###The protein pancakes were really good although our waitress was a little confused on whether or not they actually had protein powder in them or not.
pancakes###I know pancakes aren't health food but I would have liked to know how bad they really were.
###Eating out for breakfast isn't our norm so its nice to have an option like this so close to the house!
###I feel like the West Side gets the short end when it comes to new business.
###We were super excited to see a new breakfast place open up not too far from home on our side of town.
###The renovation converting it from the Good Egg  made it very bright, open and inviting.
pancake,pancake###The portions are HUGE and I highly recommend the protein pancake although I'm still unclear why it is a "protein" pancake.
blueberries,granola###I asked the waitress and she said, and this is a direct quote, "It has blueberries, granola, and almonds in it, I guess it is the almond that give it all the protein."
###Well thanks, I read the menu, I understood the ingredients, but you still didn't answer my questions.
###Whatever, it was delicious and we'd go back and get it again.
chalk###I chalk her poor product knowledge (we asked her a few other questions she couldn't answer) up to the place being new and left it at that.
###Wow! been to the other location at 7th & Greenway and as I said WOW this one was a lot better!
###Great service great food!
###We will return!
pancakes###Love this place for their protein pancakes!
###Everything else has been good too the only problem I've had at this location, (I've only been to this one and the greenway location) my eggs both times I went and ordered over medium I got them with some runny whites.
###I sent back and it was corrected.
###One time accident, two times makes me think the cook may need some additional training.
###I went again today and ordered scrambled.
###Everything else there has been wonderful and I will go back and will recommend US Egg!
###There was a normal busy Sunday morning crowd today.
###We expected the wait to be a lot longer than the 10 minutes it actually was.
###Love the new open dining area.
toast,Denver omelette###We had the French toast and Denver omelette.
###Both were great.
###We will be back for sure.
###Wanted to try a new breakfast place today.
###Decided on US Egg and Im happy we did.
###Place was clean, service was great, food was just what I was looking for.
###Staff seemed to actually care about the experience they were creating.
###Food not only tasted good, the presentation was nice as well.
###We will be going back soon im sure.
Protein pancakes###Protein pancakes are awesome!
tuna,sandwich,tuna,mayonnaise###My wife had the tuna melt,  a delightful sandwich with moist tuna but not drenched in mayonnaise.
###It also has onion and tomato but not overwhelmed by cheese.
jalapeo burger###I had the jalapeño burger.
burger###It is correctly named because it has fresh jalapeños grilled to perfection on top of this delicious burger.
burger###Accompanying the peppers is jack cheese and the normal burger toppings.
###I had eaten there a while ago and noticed that business was down this time.
###Chatting with the manager /owner he said they were having a hard time overcoming the negative image left by the previous occupant.
sandwiches###They should prepare mini sandwiches of their food and mini breakfast items that they can keep at proper temperature and then go right to numerous office buildings before work and hand out the free food.
###Also create coupons and hand them out there too.
###I bet their reputation will spread rapidly.
###It. might take effort but this place deserves to flourish.
###Our new go-to breakfast spot!
###Pleasant, updated interior, excellent, attentive staff, great food and good prices.
###Menu has large selection and they will customize.
###We were all pleased with the promptness of receiving our meal, the flavor (love the french toast), good coffee (not bland diner-style coffee) and the surroundings of a clean, modern restaurant.
###We'll be back.
###We went to U.S. Egg after my son's baptism a few weeks ago.
###We called a week ahead to put our 'name in' because our party was for 14 people and they don't technically take reservations.
###I was glad to hear that they would put our group at the top of the list for our convenience and we wouldn't have to wait that long (Which was great because we had a baby and an elderly family member).
###When the Sunday morning came (10am) we arrived and we were greeted very warmly.
###How refreshing, a busy restaurant smiling and not freaking out due to the party size.
###The restaurant was bright and seemed rather casual.
###They seated us promptly (no waiting).
cake###There was a manager (I believe) that even took our cake we had back to the fridge so it didn't take up space and would be fresh ready to go after brunch.
###He was so nice!
###Now comes the food part.
###It took a long time for a waitress to come over and take our order.
###Which was odd, you would think with a party that big, the server wouldn't have that many other tables.
###The poor girl had 4 aside from us!! Poor thing.
###Although we were starving, when the waitress did finally take our order (15+ minutes), she was very pleasant.
###I could bet she was frazzled, but she didn't show it when she arrived at our table.
###So ordering wait time was not good, but once again, customer service was nice.
###And after all, a good experience at a food restaurant is highly based on the staff.
pancakes,turkey sausage###I ordered pancakes, turkey sausage, and scrambled eggs.
###All very good, but nothing was 'amazing' or 'had to have'.
###But was hot, had just the right amt. of seasoning.
###And the food arrived pretty quickly after ordering (normal for a large party size).
###Please note, they do have a menu for gluten free I believe.
###(One member of the party had to order special for their diet).
cake###Then the manager brought out the cake we brought and a bunch of plates (and 'to go boxes for the rest of the cake).Very nice indeed.
###After all was done, we had to split the bill unfortunately, so it created a bit of havoc when separating the bill.
coffee###My sister had a coffee on her bill (and she didn't order one) and we had a whole meal added to our bill and we had to get that removed.
###The manager again stepped in and was very cordial and removed the item (after 15 min. of discussion with the waitress).
###All-in-all, we would go back to this restaurant, it wasn't that expensive, had a great staff, and decent food.
###We came across this place last Saturday morning as a quick stop before running errands.
###I didn't have the highest of expectations, as I hadn't eaten here prior.
###We were seated immediately, and greeted just as fast.
###Our server Lindzy was cheerful, polite and very helpful in suggestions.
coffee###The coffee was strong and flavorful without being overpowering, and before we finished our first cup, our food was in front of us.
chicken fried,steak,Benedict###Highly recommend the chicken fried steak, and the California Benedict was fantastic.
###Great experience all around, will definitely be going back!
###Just got back from breakfast with the family at the newest location of US Egg.
###Having never been before, I was not sure what to expect.
###Overall, I left a little disappointed.
tomatoes###I ordered the egg white garden omelet which had bell peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, and cheese.
hash browns,english muffin###It came with a side of hash browns and an english muffin.
hash browns###The portion size was amazingly huge, but the food was a bit bland...  My hash browns and omelet didn't really taste like anything.
avocado,chicken###My dad got an avocado and jack cheese omelet and my mom got the chicken and waffles.
###All of us agreed that US Egg was just okay, but there are definitely better breakfast places out there!
###I felt that they sort of nickel and dime you for everything.
salsa###I asked for a side of salsa (which was small) and they were going to charge $0.75 extra for it, which I didn't think was worth it.
###On the plus side the service was good and our waitress was patient while I took forever to choose my dish and asked if we wanted to-go drinks.
###I suppose I might try US Egg again, but I probably wouldn't order the same thing.
###This place is super close by our house so we decided to try it out for our new breakfast plate.
garden omelette,hash browns,English muffin###I ordered the garden omelette which came with hash browns and an English muffin.
hash browns###The hash browns appeared to be cooked thoroughly but were very mushy on the inside.
omelette###The omelette itself tasted like nothing.. Literally.. Nothing.
###The veggies (especially the spinach) were bland.
###I honestly told my fiancé I couldn't even taste what I was eating.
English muffin###The English muffin was cold and I don't think actually toasted.
corned beef###We were handed the wrong bill ($11 more) and when we said it wasn't ours the other waitress said "happens all the time".. Ummmmm.. My fiancé had corned beef and hash.
###I thought it tasted like dog food but he said it was mediocre.
browns###All in all, of I do ever come back, out of convenience only, I definitely wont be eating hash browns again.
###Although, it's hardly worth the $20 when you hated your meal..
###First time trying this place out, and it was actually okay.
waffle,sweet potato###I got the Belgian waffle and sweet potato fries.
waffle###The waffle was good, and crisp.
waffle,sweet potato###I really came here for a waffle but would go back for the sweet potato fries.
brown,deep fry###My grandma can't taste, and goes by texture so she asked for her hash brown extra crispy and our server offered to deep fry them.
###Although probably not so healthy it was really good!
###And my grandma loved them, and loved that our server catered to what we like!
###She was very friendly and helpful, I though the food could have come out a little faster, but then again maybe I was just hungry.
###And im sure what we ordered takes some time to cook more.
sweet potato###All in all, I like the place and will be back for more sweet potato fries;)
###Quick, friendly and efficient service.
bacon###I ordered the French Toast with a side of bacon.
###Both were attractive, plentiful and tasty.
###Convenient location just off the freeway.
###Couple of dollars more expensive than my other breakfast place but it is 3 stars and this one is 4 stars.
###There is a difference in what you get.
###Only dislike - the seating.
###Booths are probably easy to wash off but they are not comfortable.
###Food is great but it's the service that is truly exceptional!
###We go every week for breakfast and they know us by name and have our table ready.
###Their wait and bus staff are very well trained and food orders are always correct and delivered fast.
###We have a large group and they tend to special order but it's never a problem.
###We highly recommend this place for breakfast or lunch!
###Great Breakfast!
###Got the half and half.
Protein pancakes###Protein pancakes and sante fe.
###Huge portions and fresh food!
###Wish they would open one in Las Vegas
###We've been here several times.
###Food & Service are OUTSTANDING!
###The signage outside, & the name,      U.S. Egg; gives the appearance of a government surplus program.
###My husband insisted, so we gave it a try.
###I was shockingly surprised at how good it was (despite the meager, albeit very clean, furnishings & decor).
###All the frills, class & quality are put into the Food (where it really counts)!!
###We now drive the extra distance to come here more regularly.
###I wasn't a breakfast eater until I discovered the half & half.
protein pancakes###I love both the protein pancakes and the egg dishes I've tried.
###I don't understand why anybody would choose The Place over U.S. Egg .....except for longevity & reputation in the community.
###Prices & portions are comparable, but U.S. Egg is superior in quality!!
###I hope the word spreads & this little diamond located in the ruff catches on!!!
###We Love it!
###Visited this place 3 times and the experience went from pretty good, to not great, to won't return.
###If you put the word egg in your name I would expect that the eggs you prepare would be excellent, but that is not the case.
coffee,pancakes###Pancakes were borderline burned, coffee was bitter, the waitstaff while friendly was not very helpful, and although the protein pancakes are pretty good the entire breakfast for my family of 4 cost as much as a dinner usually does so we won't be returning.
###Just went here today for breakfast due to seeing the person on the street corner with the sign LOL.
###Note to marketing department - the street corner sign does work.
pancakes,pancakes###Unfortunately we were craving pancakes and the pancakes were not good at all.
###For the good,  the place was packed, but we still got seated quickly.
###Our service and food were also fast.
###Grade = A+
###
bacon###The bacon and eggs were also very good - grade = A
###
pancakes###Next, let me say that out of everyone I've ever met, a very small percentage like whole-wheat pancakes or will ever order them at a restaurant.
###(I think hippies like them, but my hippy friend prefers sweet cream pancakes).
###I have tried them a handful of times and they usually taste like crap.
###I stay away from them now.
pancakes###My son had the whole-wheat pancakes and he said they had a bitter taste.
protein pancakes,aftertaste###I had the protein pancakes, which also had a bitter aftertaste.
###This place has so many choices for other items (even non-whole wheat bread) that when you only have one type of pancake batter (one that most people don't like) it really sucks.
pancakes,pancakes###Note to restaurant, your pancakes don't taste that great and whole wheat pancakes still aren't healthy at all, so what's the point?
pancakes,batter,pancakes###I see some other people on here do like your protein pancakes, so maybe today's batch of batter was just off, but It would be great if you offered pancakes that tasted good.
Black Bear Diner###Black Bear Diner has delicious sweet cream onse if you need a recipe, since it seems your other items are pretty good.
###Grade - D
###First time and the food is amazing.
waffles###Had the waffles and it was great.
###The portions are crazy too.
###I've been here with my family several times.
###The food is awesome and so is the service.
###U.S. Egg is a great place got breakfast for the whole family.
coffee,pancakes###Great service, carafes of coffee and the protein pancakes are the best.
skillets###The skillets are also delicious and filling.
###The owners and managers stop by to check in and are very attentive.
###Expect these guys to have more and more locations.
###Wowzer!
###I love love a good breakfast and US Egg certainly came through for me.
coffee###Why is it so many places stopped the carafes of coffee?
###We need out java people!
###This lil place has the carafes, so nice!
bacon###I had the simple bacon and eggs, really filling.
french toast###My hubby had the french toast and I ate a third of it, very good.
###I am pleased and we will be back, especially for the service and coffee..ftw!
###Delicious, quality food.
###Love the atmosphere, the staff is wonderful!
Protein waffles,pancakes###Annndddd they got Protein waffles and pancakes!!!
###Service was great!
###Not as fast as the Scottsdale location but it'll get there.
pancakes###Food was delicious!! Love me some protein pancakes!!
###My breakfast was delish.
chicken,bacon###I had the Hawkeye and that chicken,  bacon and avocado was scrumptious.
###We also had a wonderful waitress, good service without hovering.
###Not too bad.
###..nothing major to comment on positive or negative.
biscuits###I had biscuits and gravy with eggs (they forgot to bring my eggs) I mentioned it to the waitress when I finally got a hold of her and at that point we were finished.
###She didn't really care no discount or anything.
biscuits###Aside from that the biscuits and gravy were decent.
BISCUITS###NOTE TO ANYONE READING THIS I AM STILL SEARCHING FOR THE BEST BISCUITS AND GRAVY IN TOWN PLEASE MESSAGE ME.
###It is my favorite breakfast and haven't found my place yet.
###I live off N. 67th Ave.
###I do have to say the French Toast my daughter had was top notch.
###I would go here if I had a hankering for it.
chicken fried steak###The chicken fried steak was fantastic - some of the best I ever had.
###Not over cooked and perfectly crispy.
mimosa###The mimosa was a bit overpriced - $5 for a small flute.
###The service was very friendly as well.
###Definitely somewhere I'd return to.
###This has been an awesome experience.
###The service is friendly and attentive.
###The food is excellent and well portioned.
###I will definitely be making returns to this location.
###Eggs Benny is great.
fruit###The fruit was on point too.
grapefruit###I'm not a fan of grapefruit but it even looked good enough for me to eat!
###This is our second time here and it doesn't dissappoint.
###Staff was great both times.
###However and this why I did not five 5 stars, this older guy sitting by the hostess stand was snorting up a storm!
###It was so gross that I couldn't finish eating.
###The first couple times it took me by surprise and I immediately looked in his direction and he was just stating at me like "what ?".
###Then after that and for the next 5 times I had it together enough to not look over.
###I'm not 100% sure but I think he is the owner.
###Course I was ear hustling and that what it sounded like.
###So disgusting sir, please go to the bathroom and blow your nose.
###Your guests do not want to hear that....and then have you stare at them.
###We were even kinda talking about it loud enough for him to hear and it did not change anything.
###This is our all time favorite place for breakfast!
###The staff is excellent and runs like clockwork, never a need to ask for a refill....
###They are on it.
pancakes,burgers,salads,chili###Great management and from the protein pancakes to omelets, burgers, salads and even chili.
###Good food and great place!
###Always Great Service & Great Food!
###Lovely Family run Business!!!!
###The Protein
###Pancakes are a must!
###Highly recommend!
###I love going to US Egg on Saturday mornings.
###Gets busy so I'd recommend coming in earlier.
coffee###They leave a water and coffee pitcher with you so no waiting for a refill.
###The staff is always very attentive even still.
coffee creamers###They have great coffee creamers, a mix of each flavor and they are not stingy on what they provide!
Benedict###Each time I get the same breakfast, California Benedict.
###No matter how many times I go it's so great that I haven't ordered anything else.
