I've been lucky enough to sample the majority of the west and east coast's famed pancake houses including The Original Pancake House in Portland, OR, Ina's in Chicago, IL, Richard Walker's Pancake House in San Diego, CA, Pamela's in Pittsburgh, PA, and even good ol' Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix

For me, my favorite is just a butter and syrup short stack that's slightly just ever so crisp on the outside, but fluffy, buttery, and melt in your mouth in the middle

---------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to their standard pancake, they have a wonderful selection of baked pancakes as well
pancake---->4.0
---------------------------------------------------------------
While their baked pancakes might not be as thick as the ones from Ina's or OPH's, they are just as flavor gasmic
pancake---->3.5
---------------------------------------------------------------
I think the thinner but still absolutely delicious texture allows you to appreciate the toppings more than when you otherwise just get a mouthful of fat pancake
pancake---->3.0
---------------------------------------------------------------
Honestly, JP is the only place in Phoenix I found that has a baked pancake, and while it's German styled thin texture is different than the east coast variety, I think it is a needed improvement of pancake to topping ratio which makes each bite more enjoyable, and appropriately portioned
pancake---->3.0

If you're looking for a Chicago style pancake the size of a pie, then this isn't it, but who gives a flying Foucault over size when the difference in texture actually IMPROVES the flavor

In short, their baked pancakes are superb, their plain pancakes are the best I've had in the US, and they refill your coffee as if it was necessary to sustain your life, which arguably, it is
